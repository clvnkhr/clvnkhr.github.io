# Publications
My publications are listed on [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7557-0786). My PhD Thesis supervised by Prof. Jos√© Rodrigo is available at the [Warwick Research Archive Portal](https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/150235/).
My research work belongs to the field of theoretical fluid mechanics, 
which is a branch of pure mathematics at the intersection of physics, harmonic analysis, computational mathematics and functional analysis.

# Notes
I have typed a number of notes for personal use. They are rough around the edges, but could be useful to others, so I will make some available here in the future. 

# Translations
I have translated some papers to English in my spare time. I will try to make them available here.
