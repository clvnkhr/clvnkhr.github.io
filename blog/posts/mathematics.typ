= Publications

My publications are listed on #link("https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7557-0786")[ORCiD]. My PhD Thesis supervised by Prof. José Rodrigo is available at the #link("https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/150235/")[Warwick Research Archive Portal].
My research work belongs to the field of theoretical fluid mechanics,
which is a branch of pure mathematics at the intersection of physics, harmonic analysis, computational mathematics and functional analysis.

= Notes and teaching

I have typed a number of notes for personal use. They are rough around the edges, but could be useful to others, so I will make some available here in the future.

In addition, I have some of my handwritten notes from unversity lectures. Here are two of them, from a course on #link("https://archive.org/details/ma-4-f-7-brownian-motion-handwritten-notes-calvin-khor")[Brownian Motion] and #link("https://archive.org/details/stochastic-analysis-handwritten-notes-calvin-khor")[Stochastic Analysis] (both at the graduate level). Mistakes are obviously my fault and not the lecturers'.

= Translations

I have translated some papers to English in my spare time. I will try to make them available here.

I am #link("https://math.stackexchange.com/users/80734/calvin-khor")[user number 80734] on Math StackExchange,
and I have also solved some Project Euler problems: #html.img(src: "https://projecteuler.net/profile/calvinkhor.png")
