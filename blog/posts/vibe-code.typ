Work and life have not allowed for a lot of free time, but LLMs now allow writing niche software extremely quickly. You even get results without knowing the language, although it can help. The techniques are evolving rapidly so I just list below some mini projects I have done.

- Web hosted Python/SQLite Todo App
- Argand diagram plotter
- this blog (see #link("/blog/2026/01/07/blog-redesign/")[this post])

In addition, the LLMs help outside the domain of coding. They have successfully helped me with things such as
- filling in expenses
- working out taxes
- writing emails
- formatting or transforming PDF files, images and other documents
- (re)learning bits of math outside my specialty
- translating
