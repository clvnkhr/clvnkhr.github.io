I have completed the following Scala Coursera courses:

1. Functional Programming Principles in Scala: essentially an intro to functional programming using Scala.
2. Functional Program Design in Scala: completes the basic concepts of functional programming (lazy evaluation, monads, type classes).
3. Programming Reactive Systems: A course in using actors and streams to write reactive code, using the Akka Actors framework.

My background before this coding-wise was that I have taken a number of relatively basic coding courses in university that covered some C and Java, and had used Python in some university projects.
