<p>My publications are listed on <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7557-0786">ORCiD</a>. My PhD Thesis supervised by Prof. José Rodrigo is available at the <a href="https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/150235/">Warwick Research Archive Portal</a>.
My research work belongs to the field of theoretical fluid mechanics,
which is a branch of pure mathematics at the intersection of physics, harmonic analysis, computational mathematics and functional analysis.</p>

<h1 id="notes-and-teaching">Notes and teaching</h1>

<p>I have typed a number of notes for personal use. They are rough around the edges, but could be useful to others, so I will make some available here in the future.</p>

<p>In addition, I have some of my handwritten notes from unversity lectures. Here are two of them, from a course on <a href="https://archive.org/details/ma-4-f-7-brownian-motion-handwritten-notes-calvin-khor">Brownian Motion</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/stochastic-analysis-handwritten-notes-calvin-khor">Stochastic Analysis</a> (both at the graduate level). Mistakes are obviously my fault and not the lecturers’.</p>

<h1 id="translations">Translations</h1>

<p>I have translated some papers to English in my spare time. I will try to make them available here.</p>
