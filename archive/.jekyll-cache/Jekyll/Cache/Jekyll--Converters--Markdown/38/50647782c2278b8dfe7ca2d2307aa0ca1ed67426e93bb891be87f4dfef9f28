I"�<p>I have completed the following Scala Coursera courses:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Functional Programming Principles in Scala: essentially an intro to functional programming using Scala.</li>
  <li>Functional Program Design in Scala: completes the basic concepts of functional programming (lazy evaluation, monads, type classes).</li>
  <li>Programming Reactive Systems: A course in using actors and streams to write reactive code, using the Akka Actors framework.</li>
</ol>

<p>My background before this coding-wise was that I have taken a number of relatively basic coding courses in university that covered some C and Java, and had used Python in some university projects.</p>
